<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Foaming Agents for Gypsum Boards Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stable Foaming Agents</li><li>Unstable Foaming Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Foaming agents for gypsum boards are classified into two main types: stable and unstable foaming agents. Stable foaming agents create long-lasting bubbles that maintain their structure during mixing and drying, resulting in enhanced strength and thermal insulation properties of the gypsum board. In contrast, unstable foaming agents produce temporary bubbles that collapse quickly, leading to a lighter board but potentially reducing overall durability. The choice between these agents impacts the board's performance characteristics, including weight, strength, and insulation.</p></p>
