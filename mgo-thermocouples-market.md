<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MGO Thermocouples Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grounded Type</li><li>Ungrounded Type</li><li>Exposed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>MGO thermocouples are categorized into three main types based on their construction and application. Grounded type thermocouples have a direct electrical connection to the sheath, offering quick response times but at the risk of electrical interference. Ungrounded type thermocouples have an insulated sensor, providing better electrical isolation and stability in fluctuating temperatures, but slower response times. Exposed type thermocouples have the sensing junction directly exposed, allowing for rapid temperature measurements in gas or liquid environments but lacking protection from contaminants.</p></p>
